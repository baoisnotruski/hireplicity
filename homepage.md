Fixes & Suggestions:

Add hover state to indicate that field is interactive and clickable. We can either change the field border color or increasing its thickness.
Add Field label instead of adding it as a placeholder. This is to avoid users going back in case they forgot what the field was about.
Show error feedback - highlight border to red, tell them what the error is (e.g. Invalid email input), and add error icon
